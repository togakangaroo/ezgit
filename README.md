I've heard it described to me before that using the git cli directly is like strapping a seat and wheels to an engine block and trying to drive. Its much easier if you have a car. Yet nobody has really created a popular cli Car for git yet. ([Git flow](http://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) is close but is more about enforcing a workflow not introducing a simpler CLI.)

`ezgit` (working title) is meant to be a task-based UI wrapper for git. It is not meant to do everything git does. It is a wrapper and you can drop down to the git level at any time. It is simply meant to wrap the most common tasks.

# Guidelines For Contributing

We're not implementing anything yet. Right now its all user stories and discussion on how this should work. The hard work here is about the *design of the user interface* not how to achieve it technically. [See the Issue Tracker](https://github.com/togakangaroo/ezgit/issues) to get involved.

As such, we're currently using the issue tracker for discussion. Lets try to focus each discussion around a user story. Remember that a user story is something that a user might be wanting to achieve. All user stories should make clear what the role of the user is, what the feature they want is, and what task they are trying to achieve that this feature would help.
